# Plan
I model these 5 unknown numbers as nodes in a graph.

Let it be edgeless initially.
I will add 7 directed edges to the graph by comparing 7 pairs of distinct nodes.
If `x > y`, then there is a edge `x -> y`.

My goal is to find a undirected graph of 5 nodes with 7 edges, such that:
For any case of the value permutations, after the edges is converted to directed by comparison on their adjacent nodes,
there is a path from the greater to the less for any two nodes.

A complete graph of 5 nodes has (5*(5-1)/2 = 10) edges.
(10 select 7) = 120 cases.
The full permutation of 5 elements = 5! = 120 cases.
- [ ] permit equal numbers

# result

found: 20
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 4)
